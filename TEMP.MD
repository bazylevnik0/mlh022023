<b>App for traveller<b><br>
I mean I trying make app for example for me<br>
What I using when travelling:<br>
-notes(addreses, guides, advices, names, phone numbers ...)<br> 
-images(maps, photos of tickets, special documents ...)<br>
-sounds(i prepare music for listening, but you can store other stuff)<br>
usually these things is in a separate apps<br>
  
in this hackhathon i can try to make one app for all this tasks<br>
it can be like a private blog(local storage, because in travel you can lost internet connection)<br>
i mean user uploading all information in a travel page and use this page while making a trip<br>
